The following are needed to execute the script successfully:

1. the script run_analysis.R
    - setwd() must be set to the main folder per the structure in the data zip file, "UCI HAR Dataset", i.e., Home Directory.  
    - The zip file directories and contents must not be tampered with.
2. Library dplyr must be installed, as this is loaded by the script.
3. My file, newCols.txt, must be in the Home Directory, as must run_analysis.R.
4. The script output, run_analysis.txt, will be produced in the Home Directory.
